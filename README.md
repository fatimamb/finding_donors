# Data Scientist Nanodegree Program
Project 1: Finding Donors for CharityML

**Project Description**

This is the first project for Data Scientist Nanodegree Program. In this project, I used sklearn and supervised learning techniques on data collected for the U.S. census to help a fictitious charity organization identify people most likely to donate to their cause.
I have used three supervised machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors , K Random Forest). 


**Data**

The modified census dataset consists of approximately 32,000 data points, with each datapoint having 13 features. 
This dataset is a modified version of the dataset published in the paper "Scaling Up the Accuracy of 
Naive-Bayes Classifiers: a Decision-Tree Hybrid", by Ron Kohavi. You may find this paper online,
with the original dataset hosted on UCI.
